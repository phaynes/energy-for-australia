# Australia’s role be in the global transition off fossil fuels; or how to put the fossil fuel industry out of business?
For the world to transition to "net-zero" - the global fossil fuel industry must effectively be put out of business with equivalent energy sources that are disruptively cheap.

Given Australia makes a negligible contribution to global CO2 emissions, even if Australia completely shut down its economy tomorrow, it would make no practical impact to a global transition off fossil fuels.

Now Australia has some of the world’s largest Uranium and Thorium deposits. Advanced fast reactors technology could enable the world existing spent nuclear fuel to be burnt and Australia’s massive Thorium deposits to effectively become a limitless supply of energy for the world.

So how can Australia make a practical impact? Develop and use at scale fast reactors to produce nuclear and chemical fuels (i.e. NH3) at a price point that will put all the worlds fossil fuel industries out of business.
