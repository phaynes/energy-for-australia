# Australia’s role be in the global transition off fossil fuels; or how to put the fossil fuel industry out of business?
Australia’s contribution to global emissions is negligible – even if our coal / gas exports are taken into consideration. 
The world needs to produce mobile fuels, heat sources, industrial processes, and electricity at a scale greater than fossil fuels,
whilst simultaneously being cheaper and not creating further global security concerns. 

Australia has some of the world’s largest Uranium and Thorium deposits. Advanced fast reactors technology would enable the world existing spent nuclear fuel to be burnt and Australia’s massive Thorium deposits to become effectively a limitless energy supply for the world. 



To have an effect we need to be able to produce and export at scale green energy that is cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalent.

If one considers the  magnitude of the task, and price points that need to be achieved against the well funded incumbent of the 
fossil fuel industry, I simply cannot see how this can be done without nuclear produced fuels (e.g. NH3), heat sources, and electricity produced with the required advanced reactor.
